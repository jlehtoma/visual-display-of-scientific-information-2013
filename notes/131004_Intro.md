## Introduction

* Does a visualization help the understanding of the topic?
* Illustration or flavor graphic differs from an infographic 

> A visual journalist's job is not to disguise the information for the page to look beautiful. Our job is explain the information.

> If the statistics are boring, then you've got the wrong numbers (Edward Tufte)

* Maps older than writing, may be even older than spoken language
  *  Zimmerman 1989: [The nervous system in the context of information theory](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-73831-9_7)

> Seeing is forgetting the name of the thing one sees (Paul ValÃ©ry)

* Seeing is intuitive to understands, language needs intermediate processing
  * [Anscombe's quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe's_quartet) a poweful example of understanding a phenomenon intuitively
  * Then again, no one has a "perfect color-eye": colors are understood only in relation to other colors

> Wow! What? Oh... (Reif Larsen)

* You have to lure the viewer in (Wow!), but the understanding part (Oh...) is *the* most important part

* Generally speaking,  visualizations good for 
  * facilitate comparison, especially between multiple data points (less than 20 numbers > table outperforms a visualization, otherwise do a visualization)
  * showing scale [http://howbigreally.com/](http://howbigreally.com/)
  * revealing the unseen
  * convincing the reader (e.g. [http://mikael.puheenvuoro.uusisuomi.fi/133117-kolme-kuvaa-ilmastonmuutoksesta](http://mikael.puheenvuoro.uusisuomi.fi/133117-kolme-kuvaa-ilmastonmuutoksesta)) - however, correlation does not imply causation, and implications (intentional or unintentional) can be strong

> A good pictorial display of data forces us to notice what we never expected to see (John Tukey)

> Comparison makes the chart meaningful (Vesa Kuusela)

* Comparing the relation makes an infographic/visualization meaningful

* Reduction of information in visualizations
  * much of information *available* may be irrelevant for the information we need (maps a good example)
  * reduction of content doesn't necessarily mean minimalism
  * aesthetics matter! Beautiful device is easier to use (subjective experience matters).

* [Isotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotype_(picture_language)) (active 1925-1971)
  * picture plane gives more degrees of freedom on layout and arranging things

> The graphic helps us understand what we see in the photo and the photo makes us believe what we see in the graphic. (Sven Lindman)
