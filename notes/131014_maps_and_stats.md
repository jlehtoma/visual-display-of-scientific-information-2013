# Maps and statistical graphics

## Statistical graphs

### Reading tips
* [Show me the number](http://www.amazon.com/Show-Me-Numbers-Designing-Enlighten/dp/0970601999): Hands on practical guide
* [Tilastografiikan perusteet](http://goo.gl/u3wv0d)
* [The transformer](http://www.amazon.com/Transformer-Principles-Making-Isotype-Charts/dp/0907259) (Isotype)

* [William Playfair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Playfair)
  * Inventor of bar, line, and pie graph!

### Bar charts

* Vertical has continuous on **both axes**
* Horizontal on the other hand can have a categorical variable on the x-axis
* Why? More intuitive + the labels on the latter take more space
* Cleveland dot plot can outperform a grouped bar chart when ncols > 2
* 

### Line chart

* Can always be used in place of a bar chart
* Bar chart will give more emphasis on the individual values, whereas a line chart will look at the trend
* Special cases:
  * Parallel coordinate chart > don't use unless sure what you're doing!
  * Sparkline > inline with the text
  * Slopegraph > typically only few time points

### Pie chart

* If you have to use one, no more than 7 slices
* Always order the slices
* Donut chart is slightly better (because we suck at comparing areas and angles) > especially true with small slices

### Scatterplot

* Bivariate plot
* Linked scatterplot > normal scatterplot, but also connect points by time

### Isotype chart

* Pictorial unit chart
* The point is not to decorate

### Do's and dont's

* Truncating charts
  * Only okay in bar charts if couple of bars are too long
  * With line charts it's more okay, as long as you're not distorting the big picture
 
* Aspect ratio
  * Typically: average slope of your graph ~45 degrees > do try different ones
  * Problem mostly with line charts

* Scale
  * Log-scales usually a problem in more popular publications
