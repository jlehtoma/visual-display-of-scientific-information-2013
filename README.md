### VISUAL DISPLAY OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION (1 ECTS)
4, 11, 14, and 21 October 2013, 12:15-15:00, room 6602, Biocenter 3, Viikki

**Teacher:** Information designer Juuso Koponen, visiting lecturer at Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture  
**Objectives:** This course aims to give a basic skill set for clear, concise and attractive visual presentation of data and scientific findings in papers, posters and presentations. The topics covered on the course include:
* basics of graphic design (typography, page layout, grid systems ect.)
* perceptual psychology applied to visual communication (Gestalt laws, pop-out features, visual variables ect.)
* choosing the correct type of chart, map or other type of graphic to best present the data on hand
* interactive visualisations and visual data exploration


**Methods and contents:** In addition to lectures, students will work on a visualisation of their own, which will be critiqued at the end of the course. Students are encouraged to bring their own data for this exercise, but prepared datasets on a variety of topics will be available, too. 
The assignment will require some working outside lecture times.
Pre-required knowledge: Particular software for producing visualisations are not discussed in detail on the course. Basic familiarity with a spreadsheet programme, such as Excel or Google Spreadsheets, is sufficient for following the lectures and working on the visualisation exercise. Other visualisation software may also be used, such as:
* statistical software, eg. R, SPSS
* GIS software, eg. Quantum GIS, ArcGIS
* vector drawing programs, eg. Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw, Inkscape
* programming tools, eg. Processing, D3.js
* web-based visualization tools, eg. Tableu Public, Google Fusion Tables


Depending on the data used, it may also be possible to produce the visualisation without using a computer at all.

**Quota:** 15 students

The deadline for applications is 19 September 2013. To apply, please fill in this form.
